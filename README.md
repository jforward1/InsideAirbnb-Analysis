# Inside-Airbnb-Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes NYC Airbnb rental prices through the year 2025. It starts with exploratory data analysis and preprocessing to remove outlier/scam listings and computes key summary statistics to understand how the data is distributed. Trends across seasons and boroughs is examined and displayed in meaningful graphs.

# Research Questions
Through this project I aim to answer the following:
- Are there seasonal patterns in Airbnb pricing?
- How are Airbnb prices distributed across NYC boroughs?
- How are Airbnb prices distributed across Manhattan, specifically?
- What rental features have the highest correlation with price?
